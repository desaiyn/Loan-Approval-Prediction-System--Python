## Loan Approval System

## Project Overview
The Loan Approval System is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether an applicant will receive a loan based on various factors such as income, credit history, and other attributes.

## Features
- Successfully preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and categorical data.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key factors affecting loan approval.
- Applied multiple classification models, including:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
- Achieved the highest accuracy of **83%** using the Naive Bayes model.
- The Naive Bayes model was chosen for its strong performance in handling data distribution and categorical features.
- The final model can effectively predict whether an applicant will get a loan based on their financial and credit history.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Train and evaluate different classification models.
4. Used the Naive Bayes model for loan approval predictions.

## Results
- The Naive Bayes model outperformed other classification models with an accuracy of **83%**.
- Key factors influencing loan approval include income, credit history, and loan amount.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy by tuning hyperparameters or using ensemble learning.
- Incorporate additional features for better predictive performance.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time loan approval predictions.
